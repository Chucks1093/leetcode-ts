# 🔐**LeetCode Solutions in TypeScript**

📝 In this repository, you will find TypeScript implementations of LeetCode questions that I have solved. Each solution is carefully designed to solve the problem efficiently and provide clear and concise code. Solutions may include explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and relevant test cases.

## Usage

🔍 To access the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chucks1093/leetcode-ts.git`
2. Navigate to the specific problem's folder to view the TypeScript solution.
3. Review the code, comments, and any accompanying explanations to understand the solution.
4. Run the solution locally using a TypeScript compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports TypeScript.

## Folder Structure

📂 The repository follows a structured folder organization for easy navigation:

```
├── Problem1
│   ├── solution.ts
│   └── README.md
├── Problem2
│   ├── solution.ts
│   └── README.md
├── ...
└── README.md
```

- Each problem is located in its own folder, such as `Problem1` and `Problem2`.
- Inside each problem folder, you will find a `solution.ts` file containing the TypeScript code for the problem's solution.
- Additionally, each problem folder may include a `README.md` file with additional information, explanations, and test cases specific to that problem.
